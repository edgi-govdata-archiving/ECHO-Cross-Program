It includes information from EPA's programs covering air (the Clean Air Act, or CAA), water (the Clean Water Act, or CWA) and hazardous and other waste handling (the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act, or RCRA). ECHO data is available here on inspections, violations and enforcements by EPA, state and other agencies. Information made accessible here runs from the present day (the database is refreshed weekly) back to 2001, which is when the EPA believes the data to be most reliable. It is available at the Congressional District level for a selected state, and for counties and zip codes of your choosing. "
