# ECHO-Cross-Programs
Jupyter notebooks for ECHO that use data from multiple
EPA programs.

---

## Notebook validation
**Basic function**
- [ ] Does it run all the way through as a Colab notebook when you are signed in as someone with no special EDGI access?
- [ ] Does it create the outputs it is supposed to create (graphs, data exports, etc.)?
- [ ] Does it run smoothly when 10+ people are on at the same time?

**Usability**
- [ ] Are the instructions sensible to a non-coder?
- [ ] Have code blocks been streamlined as much as possible (combined where they could be)?

**Completeness & accuracy**
- [ ] Do all code blocks do what comments and text say it will do?
- [ ] Is the data used appropriate to the questions being asked?
- [ ] Have we spot checked 3 specific facility reports against the online ECHO data?
- [ ] Provenance: does the notebook indicate the time/date of the data download? 

**Contextualization**
- [ ] Are there any abbreviations or technical references that would leave a non-expert confused?
- [ ] Is it clear where the data is coming from, what the timeline is, where the data may be lacking?

**Impartiality**
- [ ] Does the language used make sense across all of the parameters the notebook might use (different districts, months, etc. depending on notebook)?
- [ ] Is the language impartial (not opinionated)?
- [ ] Are all context references factual and cited?

**Figure completeness**
- [ ] Does every figure have a title, legend, and labels on x and y axes?

**Figure accuracy**
- [ ] Are all labels, titles, and legend items accurate to what is being displayed?
- [ ] If this notebook is run across widely varied parameters, can the figures from different runs be directly compared without being misleading? (Look out for e.g. auto-scaling, inadequate labeling)

**Figure elegance**
- [ ] Are figures and figure elements appropriately sized for legibility?
- [ ] Are scales interpretable?**
- [ ] Do figures compellingly display the answer to a question the notebook asks?

**EDGI and EEW branding**
- [ ] Is the EEW logo included at the top of the notebook?
- [ ] Do figures use EDGI brand colors where appropriate?
