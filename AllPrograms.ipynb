It includes information from EPA's programs covering air quality (the Clean Air Act, or CAA), water quality (the Clean Water Act, or CWA), drinking water (Safe Drinking Water Act, SDWA) and hazardous and other waste processing (the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act, or RCRA). \n",

The data made accessible here runs from the present day (the database is refreshed weekly) back to 2001, which is when the EPA believes the data to be most reliable. It is available at the Congressional District level for a selected state, and for counties and zip codes of your choosing. "
